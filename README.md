# computer-organization
This repository has contained some files and codes for the computer organization, as a supplement to CSAPP.

why is that?

In my opinion, the CSAPP is a total introduction to the computer,but it does not contain all the thing.

The textbook<计算机组成与设计：硬件/软件接口Mips版> can give a better understanding of  the whole computer organization, which makes sense to my following learning about the computer architech.
